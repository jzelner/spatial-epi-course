After a few minutes tinkering...he fastens the mouthpiece over his face and releases the gas. Within seconds, his head hits the desk. Then, minutes later, he wakes, consults his watch through blurred vision. He reaches for his pen, and starts recording the data." (From Johnson (2007b))

## The foul quality of London's water was well-known

## Building the case for the water supply 

.pull-left[
- Snow noticed that different neighborhoods were likely to have differential exposure to .alert[wastewater] based on their geographic position in the city and water supplier.


- Consulted tables from the city of London and found that the per-capita Cholera death rate .alert[south] of the Thames was 8/1000, approx 3x more than the city as a whole.

## Consistency .alert[across spatial scales] is the centerpiece of Snow's argument

.pull-left[
&gt; "Whether you looked at the evidence on the scale of an urban courtyard or on the scale of entire city neighborhoods, the same pattern repeated itself: the cholera seemed to segment itself around .alert[shared water supplies]." (Johnson, p.74)

# Snow's Grand Experiment

- Take advantage of changes in infrastructure to compare neighborhoods served with contaminated and clean water.

--

- Focused on understanding the causes of .alert[endemic] cholera in London

--

- Example of a natural experiment.

--

## What is a natural experiment?

- Exploits some kind of random variation in exposure to make causal inferences where they would otherwise not be possible. 

--

- What are some other potential examples?

---

## Changes in London water service provided an opportunity 

- Around 1850, parliament mandated that all water companies move their intake beyond the outflow of the Thames by 1855.

--

.pull-left[

- In south London there were two major water suppliers: Southwark &amp; Vauxhall (S&amp;V) and Lambeth.

- Lambeth moved the intake up in .1852, but S&amp;V waited until .red[1855].

## Snow took advantage of spatial differences in .alert[exposure]
.pull-left[

![](images/snow_water_map.jpg)

]

.pull-right[
- Snow divided data into sub-districts of South London organized by water supplier.

- 12 were served by only S&amp;V, 3 by Lambeth alone

- 1/100 people died of Cholera in .alert[S&amp;V only] districts, but none among the &gt; 14K Lambeth districts
]
---

## A wrinkle in the Grand Experiment...
.middle[

.pull-left[

- But: 16 sub-districts were served by both suppliers

- Within these districts, water service was overlapping at a fine scale.

- Population data were not available at a fine enough scale to figure out who was at risk and where.

## Discussion Questions

1. What .alert[scales] of surveillance and intervention are  important for achieving global Cholera elimination?

--

2. Which of the proposed interventions have a spatial component?

--

3. What is the rationale behind targeting hotspot areas?

--

4. What challenges or risks might be associated with the hotspot-focused approach?
