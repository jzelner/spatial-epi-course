## The foul quality of London's water was well-known

## Building the case for the water supply 

.pull-left[
- Snow noticed that different neighborhoods were likely to have differential exposure to .alert[wastewater] based on their geographic position in the city and water supplier.


- Consulted tables from the city of London and found that the per-capita Cholera death rate .alert[south] of the Thames was 8/1000, approx 3x more than the city as a whole.

> "Whether you looked at the evidence on the scale of an urban courtyard or on the scale of entire city neighborhoods, the same pattern repeated itself: the cholera seemed to segment itself around .alert[shared water supplies]." (Johnson, p.74)

# Snow's Grand Experiment

- Take advantage of changes in infrastructure to compare neighborhoods served with contaminated and clean water.

--

- Focused on understanding the causes of .alert[endemic] cholera in London

--

- Example of a natural experiment.

--

## What is a natural experiment?

- Exploits some kind of random variation in exposure to make causal inferences where they would otherwise not be possible. 

--

- What are some other potential examples?

---

## Changes in London water service provided an opportunity 

- Around 1850, parliament mandated that all water companies move their intake beyond the outflow of the Thames by 1855.

--

.pull-left[

- In south London there were two major water suppliers: Southwark & Vauxhall (S&V) and Lambeth.

- Lambeth moved the intake up in .1852, but S&V waited until .red[1855].

## Snow took advantage of spatial differences in .alert[exposure]
.pull-left[

![](images/snow_water_map.jpg)

]

.pull-right[
- Snow divided data into sub-districts of South London organized by water supplier.

- 12 were served by only S&V, 3 by Lambeth alone

- 1/100 people died of Cholera in .alert[S&V only] districts, but none among the > 14K Lambeth districts
]
---

## A wrinkle in the Grand Experiment...
.middle[

.pull-left[

- But: 16 sub-districts were served by both suppliers

- Within these districts, water service was overlapping at a fine scale.

- Population data were not available at a fine enough scale to figure out who was at risk and where.

# Using spatial data to make policy and practice arguments

## Discussion Questions

1. What .alert[scales] of surveillance and intervention are  important for achieving global Cholera elimination?

--

2. Which of the proposed interventions have a spatial component?

--

3. What is the rationale behind targeting hotspot areas?

--

4. What challenges or risks might be associated with the hotspot-focused approach?
