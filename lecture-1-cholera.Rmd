# John Snow and the "Ghost map"


---

# How was the case made for the role of water in the 1854 London Cholera outbreak?

Reflecting on "Sick City":

1. What were the relevant .alert[spatial scales] of analysis for making the argument?

--

2. What made .alert[miasma] theory so hard to dislodge, even in the face of strong evidene?

--

3. Did snow work alone? Who else helped develop his theory?

--

4. What are some more-recent analogues of miasma theory?

> "[John Snow] sits alone in his cluttered flat, frogs croaking around him, illuminated only by candlelight. After a few minutes tinkering...he fastens the mouthpiece over his face and releases the gas. Within seconds, his head hits the desk. Then, minutes later, he wakes, consults his watch through blurred vision. He reaches for his pen, and starts recording the data." (From `r Citet(bib,"johnson2007")`)

- In south London there were two major water suppliers: Southwark & Vauxhall (S&V) and Lambeth.

- Lambeth moved the intake up in 1852, but S&V waited until .red[1855].

# Snow took advantage of  spatial differences in .alert[exposure] to conduct a natural experiment

- Partitioned death register data into sub-districts of South London organized by water supplier.

--

- 12 were served by only S&V, 3 by Lambeth alone.

- 1/100 people died of Cholera in .alert[S&V only] districts, but none among the > 14K Lambeth districts.

#  A wrinkle in the Grand Experiment

- 16 sub-districts were served by both suppliers

- Within these districts, water service was overlapping at a fine scale.

- Population data were not granular enough to figure out who was at risk and where.

- Should thisimpact our evaluation of his results?
